{- I'm sorry I haven't quite finished setting this exercise yet, but by
   the joy of version control, the rest of it can be merged in later
   (quite soon). At least you can get cracking: I promise not to break
   anything, just to add a bit more on the end.

   The deadline for this is Friday of Week 12 (11 Dec).
   It'd be good to get the marks in before Christmas, but if the end of
   term is looking deadlinetastic, please open negotiations.

   UPDATE: I had to work around a bug in Agda to get this finished, so
   it took longer than I had hoped. I apologise, and will be flexible
   with deadlines, consequently. Also, I had to tweak the setup for
   cp a little, asking you to abstract out your definition of the
   FinalState of cp. I need to refer to it in the later code. That may
   cause a wee merge conflict, easily rectified with cut and paste.

   be some states in which it is safe to escape (and deliver a suitable
   error message, perhaps) and other states in which escape should be
   impossible.

   If it is safe to issue an error message, we should be able to do so
   without fear of any response from the environment that would oblige
   us to carry on.

{- HINTS
  You will certainly need to build some extra bits and pieces.

  You have the components for reading, writing and error handling, and
  suitable kit with which to combine them. Reading and writing don't
  interfere with each other, but it's important to make sure that you
  can't bomb out with an error, so some shared state seems important.

  There are really two phases to the process:
    (1) getting the files open  -- this may go wrong
    (2) copying from one to the other  -- this will work if we reach it
  You might want to split these phases apart.
-}

---------------------------------------------------------------
-- TO BE CONTINUED... 
---------------------------------------------------------------

-- The rest of the exercise is to fill selected gaps in code that
-- gets your cp process to the stage where it actually compiles.

-- Agda version 2.4.2.4 is needed t compile the "copatterns" involved
-- in the code, but you should be able to complete the exercise
-- without upgrading, if you are currently using an earlier version.
-- It is only the business of generating a standalone executable that
-- needs the upgrade. Still, it'd be nice to see it go, wouldn't it?

-- The key is to build a device driver between your carefully
-- designed command-response system and "scripts" built from
-- low-level Haskell commands, maintaining the file handles
-- involved as you go.

-- Then you'll need to explain how to run the low-level script.

   for responses (which should pack up all the responses to the
   commands) and compute the next state (which should be the state
   the system reaches when the script stops).

   one SCRIPT C interaction to many C interactions. That's to say,
